README.md

Due to some complication caused by COVID-19, Allegra has applied for an extension, but Cameron has not. Therefore, it is important to seperate out whose work is whose.

Cameron's contrubution is in CKS.Rmd and Interactive.Rmd (along with their corresponding HTML files). Please grade
that .Rmd file, although note that there are some sections included which were Allegra's part of the project, and are
thus pretty sparse.

A temporary website has been created by Cameron, although the original plan was to have Allegra set that up.

The temprorary webiste can be found at: https://sites.google.com/carleton.edu/finalprojectmath285-at-cks/

 Be aware that you will need to be signed in to a Carleton College account see this website.
  Also, for some reason the interactive graph is not showing up here. I don't know how to fix this, but the code
  (and HTML file) are both in this github directory.

The files in the directory (as written by Cameron when he submitted) are:

  .gitignore: (this is unused) 
  
  2018_sqf_database.csv the original version of the data set, taken from https://www.nyclu.org/en/stop-and-frisk-data
  
  **CKS.Rmd**:	Cameron Kline-Sharpe's Part of the Submission (GRADE THIS)
  
  CKS.nb.html	Cameron Kline-Sharpe's Part of the Submission (in html format)
  
  final-project-AllegraTashjian-CameronKlineSharpe.Rproj	Used by R Markdown to interface with Git
  
  interactive.Rmd	Cameron Kline-Sharpe's Part of the Submission	 (a placeholder interactive graph)
  
  interactive.nb.html	Cameron Kline-Sharpe's Part of the Submission	(in html format)
  
  stopFrisk.csv An edited version of the 2018_sqf_database.csv fie where all "(nulls)" are removed.
